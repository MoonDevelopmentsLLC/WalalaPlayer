# Walala Wallpaper Player
Walala is a wallpaper player for windows, fast, and scripted so simple anyone could audit it.

# Current Working Features : 
Live Wallpapers compatible with common video formats, auto-restart, auto-startup with system, and last played video memory.

Settings are stored in a simple txt document created whereever the exe is, the program is 100% portable. 

Python was chosen because it is beginner friendly and understood very well by LLMS, allowing anyone to contribute.

# Current bugs :
 When having multiple monitors, the extra monitors have the taskbar hidden unless there is a window or program open. (Even having resmon or task manager open is enough to stop the bug from happening for now) Maybe this function/bug can be turned into a toggle for people who like the auto fullscreen effect when extra monitors are not in use.

Desktop icons are hidden but can still be clicked, once again, maybe a future toggle.               

# Contributions :
 All contributions are welcomed, just don't break the program or do anything malicious please check your changes first to verify stability :). 

# Building :
 Can be built with pyinstaller using the line in command.txt or any other python compiler. If unable, it can be ran by simply installing python and double clicking the script.

# Usage : 
The pre-compiled exe in releases is ready to go, just run it, choose your video and hit start.
